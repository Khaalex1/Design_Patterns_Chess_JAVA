# Design_Patterns_Chess_JAVA

A chess game implemented with my friend and colleague H. BONTEMPS in JAVA and using Design Patterns (SOLID principles, TCP, Observer, Component and Strategy patterns).

While the code still remains non-optimized and implements superficially some patterns, it was a great introduction to "good programming habits" and helped to better understand the utility of patterns.

Note that while the game is perfectly playable for 2 distant players (if, of course, on the same network), castling doesn't work as expected, which would have to be further looked on in the future.

Another readme in french further explains how the project was conducted.
